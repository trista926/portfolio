### Common app Essay
“The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?”
    
During the summer, most people always want to hide in the shadows hiding from the bask in the sun. But as an athlete, I had to learn to step out of the shadows and face the heat. I’ve been playing tennis for about eight years. At first, I loved it. I enjoyed the game, the strategy, and the feeling of hitting a clean shot, but over time, my progress began to slow down. During the training, especially when I didn’t perform well or even when my coach was simply in a bad mood, I would get cursed and insulted. When I started to feel like something I loved slowly turned into something I feared. The words every time my coach scolded me were harsh. He said almost all the bad words and dirty words at me and also told me things like,
    
“This is the easiest thing to do! Why can’t you even do this?” Over time, I began to believe him, I started to feel like I was as bad as he said I was. Whenever he got angry and mad at me, I cried, however I would only be scolded more harshly for doing so. The punishments weren’t just oral. He would make me do frog jumps around the court in front of everyone, where many people were around and watching me. The fear of playing tennis started to grow, I started playing like a beginner and began to hate playing tennis. Then I started to tell my mom that I wanted to quit, she asked me why and I told her the whole story. However, she didn’t want me to quit, she wanted me to overcome and learn from it. She told my
coach about this and told him that from now on, she didn’t want him training me directly. Instead, letting one of his staff members take over it. She insisted that I need to continue to play once a week, not because she didn’t believe in me, but because she wanted me to find a way back to something I once loved, without fear attached to it, I have to learn how to get out of the shadow. At first, I was still resistant to play even with a new coach who was trying to help me overcome the fear of playing tennis, but the original coach still stood on the side of the court watching me, sometimes making satire comments about my playing. I couldn’t block him out, I wanted to run away, but then my mom told me something that
changed everything.

“Instead of being scared, try to think about how to overcome it. What the original coach says doesn’t have to matter. His mouth is on his body, but your ears are on yours. If you take every word to heart, you’re the one who gets hurt. Just let it go in one ear and out the other. ”

I start to think about this, and start learning how to apply in my daily life and overcome being afraid of my coach and playing tennis. I listened to the useful parts of feedback and let the rest fade away. It wasn’t easy, but I started to regain my confidence, one small step at a time. This experience didn’t just change the way I play tennis, it changed how I respond to negative comments in daily life. For example, when a schoolmate talks behind my back, or even in front of me, it wouldn’t shake me anymore, or even when a teacher was angry and misunderstands me and started to scold me badly, I won’t be as frustrated as I was. Now, I’m not afraid of that coach anymore, I still love to play tennis. I know now that stepping out of the shadows doesn’t mean the sun won’t burn and I found the courage to stand in the light anyway.
